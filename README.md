With configurable thresholds, skill selection, and optional email notifications, this plugin is a handy tool for players who want to keep track of their boosted stats effectively.

Skill Selection: Choose which skill you'd like to monitor for boosts.
Email Notifications: Receive alerts via email when your skill boost reaches your configured thresholds. Configurable SMTP settings ensure flexibility for different email providers.
Custom Email Subject: Choose your own email subject for the notifications, making it easy to identify the alert in your inbox.
